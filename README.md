An elementary statistical learning model for predicting second hand car prices, given certain definitive features of the car.

Algorithm --> **K-Nearest Neighbours** (owing to the cars with similar features being priced around some central value)        
Dataset source --> Kaggle   
Accuracy achieved --> **66.11%**
